# Sales Prediction using Python

To develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales using historical data, enabling informed decision-making for businesses to optimize their sales¬†strategies.

## Tasks Performed

- Data Preprocessing: Loaded the dataset, dropped unnecessary columns, and split the data into training and testing sets.
- Feature Engineering: No additional feature engineering was performed.
- Model Selection: Chose Linear Regression as the predictive model.
- Model Training: Trained the Linear Regression model on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance on the testing data using the accuracy score.
- Prediction: Made predictions on the testing data using the trained model.


## Data Source

The project utilizes Sales-related data obtained from [Kaggle](). The dataset includes essential details such as TV,	Radio, Newspaper, and	Sales information. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, allowing the model to undergo training on the former and be subsequently evaluated on the latter.
